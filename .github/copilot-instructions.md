Always extensively document functions

Always extensively document methods

Always extensively document tests

All test functions should have a documentation block above them that says folled by standard documentation:
```
// IMPORTANT: The documentation comment block below should not be removed unless
// the test itself is removed. Only modify the comment if the test's functionality
// changes. These comments are essential for understanding the test's purpose
// and approach, especially for future maintainers and code reviewers.
```

Always escape tripple backticks with a backslash in documentation

When updating tests update the documentation as well so it stays consistent
