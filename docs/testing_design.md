# apt-cacher-go Testing Design Document

## Testing Strategy

apt-cacher-go employs a comprehensive testing strategy covering:

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. End-to-end tests simulating actual client behavior
4. Performance benchmarks for critical paths

### Test Environments

- Local development environment
- CI pipeline with automated tests
- Docker-based integration test environment

## Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:

- Cache operations (store, retrieve, expire)
- Path mapping rules
- Backend connection handling
- Configuration parsing
- Metrics collection

### Testing Frameworks

- Go's built-in testing package
- Testify for assertions and mocking
- httptest for HTTP handler testing

## Integration Testing

Integration tests verify interactions between components:

- Cache and backend manager coordination
- Server handling of various request types
- End-to-end request flow with mocked backends

### Test Data

- Sample package and index files
- Various repository structures
- Edge cases (large files, malformed requests)

## Performance Testing

Performance tests measure:

- Request throughput under various loads
- Memory usage patterns
- Cache hit ratio impact on performance
- Concurrent download capabilities

### Benchmarks

- Single package download speed
- Multiple simultaneous client simulation
- Large repository index handling
- Cache pruning performance

## Test Coverage

- Target: >80% code coverage
- Critical path coverage: >95%
- Automated coverage reporting in CI

## Docker-Based Testing

The project includes a Docker-based testing environment that:

1. Sets up multiple APT clients
2. Configures an apt-cacher-go instance
3. Simulates package installations and updates
4. Measures performance metrics
5. Validates cache behavior

## Continuous Integration

The CI pipeline includes:

1. Running unit tests on every commit
2. Integration tests on pull requests
3. Performance benchmarks compared to baseline
4. Code coverage reporting
5. Static analysis with Go linters
